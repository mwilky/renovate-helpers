3.0

- Updated to February builds
-Added initial support for the Android 12L beta. As apktool hasn't been updated to support Android 12L yet, the 12L features are minimal. Please don't report things not working as I am already aware of it. I wasn't going to include support until everything had been ported but I thought as I have already done bits, why not share it.
- Option to select different quicksettings icon style (stock, circle with no label, square with no label)
The circle and square styles I have tried to get looking as close to "pre Android 12" as possible. I am still looking at bringing back the label but it is a big change.
- Option to set number of quicksetting columns
- Option to set number of quicksetting rows
- Option to set number of quick quicksetting rows
Depending on which style you choose, I set defaults and different maximum/minimum values. For example stock style tiles I don't allow more than 4 columns as things start to look ugly.
- Option to enable outline on quicksetting tiles
- Option to set the width of quicksetting tile outline
- Option to set the corner radius of quicksetting tile outline (stock style or square only)
- Option to set the color of quicksetting tile outline
- Option to link quicksettings outline color to system accent colour (premium only)
-Fixed RiCE app not detecting license and ROM version on fresh app install
All the quicksettings tile tweaks work without requiring a reboot as it is all controlled in code, not just resource overlaying.
